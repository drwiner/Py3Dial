#NLG message generation rules
# Last modified by JS on June 06, 2006

# This file consists of two parts:

# The first section is a list of rules defining system prompts for dialogue acts.
# You can use $A, $B, $C as variables for slot names and $U, $V, $W, $X, $Y, $Z as variables for value names.
# You can use vertical bars "|" to define several messages for the same dialogue act.

# The second section contains a list of venues and locations. You can copy and paste this part from JVrules.txt.
# Just add an asterisk "*" to all venue and location names that require the article "the" in sentences
# like "I can recommend X"

%count_rest($count) {
  0 : "are no venues";
  1 : "is one venue";
